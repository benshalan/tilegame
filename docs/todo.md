## Timing Movement

We want to update movement every game clock, after accumulating the movement that equals a step, we want to stop movement.
Add movement trait, remove it when no longer move

## Coordinate units

One movement is 1.0 floating translation difference

use meter as base unit for the coordinate system, meaning 1.0 is 1.0 meters in world equivalents
